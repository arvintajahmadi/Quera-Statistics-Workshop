# Quera-Statistics-Workshop
Instructed basic hypothesis testing for data science in Python using SciPy.
In Quera bootcamps, we try to level up our participants with new tools and stuff they will be needing as a data scientist.
Statistics plays a great role in the industry and being proficient in it will lead to standing out in the pool of junior data scientists. Hence not only we've had classes about the subject, but also we have prepared this workshop to show them how their lessons will be used on a real data.
The notebok was prepared and presented for the respective application.
